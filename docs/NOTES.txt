NOTE:
You must make clean before every make, and re-pip-install candle_lib!
Sphinx will not update automatically.

Adding a new example:

1. Add a 00<x-name>.ipynb file to the docs/examples folder
2. Add a title/thumbnail for the example in docs/gallery.yml file
3. Make sure that the example has a markdown heading. Eg. # Candle Compliance Example.
Note the "#" - This is used for getting the entry in drop down.
