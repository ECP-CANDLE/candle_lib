NOTE:
You must re-pip-install candle_lib before re-building the docs!
Sphinx docs are based on the pip-installed copies.

To add a new function:
Add it to the corresponding api_*/index.rst file

Adding a new example:

1. Add a 00<x-name>.ipynb file to the docs/examples folder
2. Add a title/thumbnail for the example in docs/gallery.yml file
3. Make sure that the example has a markdown heading. Eg. # Candle Compliance Example.
Note the "#" - This is used for getting the entry in drop down.
